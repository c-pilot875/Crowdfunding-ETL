# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Purpose of the Prject
The purpose for the crowd funding project was to analyse the crowdfunding data and identify contacts that have pledged to a live campaign. Further analysis was done to idenfity how much fudning was left to go for each live campaign and to create a list of all contacts with remaining pldge amounts along with their email address.


### Challenges
For deliverable 4, I was not able to write the correct syntax to create a remaining_goals_amount column to the campaign table. I had an idea of how to subtract the pledge column from the goal column and filling the remaining_goal column with the values using abs, but was not successful. 

### I attempted to write the new table syntax to join the columns from the campaign table and backers table, however I was not able to correctly pull the data and create the required csv files.
