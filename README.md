# Crowdfunding-ETL

### For deliverable 4, I was not able to write the correct syntax to create a remaining_goals_amount column to the campaign table. I had an idea of how to subtract the pledge column from the goal column and filling the remaining_goal column with the values using abs, but was not successful. 

### I attempted to write the new table syntax to join the columns from the campaign table and backers table, however I was not able to correctly pull the data and create the required csv files.
